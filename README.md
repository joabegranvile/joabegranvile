## About Me ðŸ‘‹  

Hello! I am a software developer passionate about building scalable and efficient solutions. With a focus on **back-end development and infrastructure**, I also master essential tools for **front-end development**. I value best practices, clean code, and process automation, always striving to optimize both system performance and team workflows.  

### ðŸ’¼ **Technologies and Tools**  
- **Back-end**: NestJS, TypeScript  
- **Front-end**: Vue.js  
- **Infrastructure and DevOps**:  
  - **Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)** with autoscaling support  
  - **Terraform** for infrastructure as code  
  - **NGINX** as a web server and reverse proxy  
  - **Docker and Docker Compose** for containerization and local orchestration  
- **Database**: PostgreSQL  
- **Version Control**: Git and GitHub  
- **Automation**: Makefile for task automation  

### ðŸ“Š **How I Work**  
In my projects, I follow a **modular, microservices-oriented approach**. I have experience in architectures where **one microservice communicates with another** to send notifications (e.g., password resets), ensuring seamless and scalable integration. Additionally, I have worked on **GKE configurations using Terraform**, applying best practices with **preemptible nodes** to optimize costs in non-production environments. The use of **Docker and Kubernetes** is key to creating isolated, reproducible environments, while **GKE autoscaling** ensures both performance and cost efficiency.  

### ðŸš€ **What Drives Me**  
My mission is to **improve systems and processes**, whether by optimizing a projectâ€™s infrastructure or implementing efficient pipelines. Technology is constantly evolving, and I love learning new stacks and tools to further enhance my work. I am naturally curious and value **collaboration and continuous growth**.
